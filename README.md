# YouTube Fast Forward & Rewind
A YouTube extension that adds custom skip and rewind buttons to the player, so you can choose how much time you want to jump forward or backward.

Plans to add to the chrome store in the future.
#
- Custom Buttons: Set your own fast forward and rewind times for better control.
- Easy Navigation: The buttons are built right into the YouTube player for quick access.
- Auto Save: Your settings are saved automatically, so you don't have to reset them every time.
